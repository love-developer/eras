### User Testing Priorities
1. Intuitiveness - can users figure it out?
2. Delight factor - does it spark joy?
3. Replay value - still fun the 10th time?
4. Accessibility - works for all users?
5. Performance - smooth on low-end devices?

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Track these for each ceremony:
- Completion rate (users who finish vs skip)
- Time to complete (too long = boring)
- Replay frequency (how often re-opened)
- User delight scores (surveys)
- Social shares (ceremony screenshots)

---

## ✨ Final Thoughts

Each ceremony should tell a story and create an emotional moment. The best ceremonies will be:
- **Intuitive** - obvious what to do
- **Satisfying** - tactile/haptic feedback
- **Beautiful** - visually stunning
- **Fast** - under 10 seconds ideal
- **Memorable** - worth sharing

The goal: Make opening a time capsule feel like **unwrapping a gift from your past self**.
