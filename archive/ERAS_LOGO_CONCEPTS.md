## 📐 CONCEPT 1: "The Hourglass Portal"
**Theme:** Time flowing through a dimensional gateway

### Visual Description:
- **Static Logo:** A geometric hourglass shape where the narrow center acts as a portal/gateway
- Top half: Solid form (the past - crystallized, defined)
- Bottom half: Scattered particles (the future - forming, emerging)
- The center "neck" is a glowing horizontal line that suggests a threshold
- Modern, minimalist linework with a single accent color (deep indigo or warm amber)

### Eras Gate Animation:
1. **Initial State (Closed):** Hourglass appears complete, center line is thin
2. **Opening:** The center line expands vertically, splitting the hourglass in two halves
3. **Open State:** Top and bottom halves slide apart vertically, revealing the content in the center gap
4. **Visual Effect:** Particles from top half "flow" down into bottom half during opening
5. **Timing:** 0.8s ease-out

### Why It Works:
- Instantly communicates "time" without being literal
- Portal metaphor fits the capsule delivery moment perfectly
- Particle flow creates mesmerizing animation
- Sophisticated, not playful - premium feel

### Color Palette:
- **Primary:** Deep Indigo (#1E1B4B) or Midnight Blue (#0F172A)
- **Accent:** Warm Amber (#F59E0B) or Soft Gold (#FCD34D)
- **Particles:** Gradient from accent to primary (web only, solid on mobile)
